# My Portfolio Website

Hey! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and experience. I built this to have a cool place to send recruiters and to practice my React/Next.js skills.

## Tech Stack

*   **Next.js**: For the framework (honestly, it makes routing so much easier).
*   **React**: For all the components.
*   **Framer Motion**: Used this for all the cool animations (like the shooting stars and scrolling effects).
*   **CSS Modules**: To keep the styling organized and not messy.

## Features I Added

1.  **Shooting Stars Background**: I found a way to make these stars shoot across the screen randomly. It looks pretty sick.
2.  **Project Carousel**: You can scroll through my projects horizontally.
3.  **Spotlight Cards**: When you hover over the project cards, there's a spotlight effect that follows your mouse.
4.  **Custom Logo**: I coded my own "S" logo using SVG so it scales perfectly.
5.  **Scroll Progress**: There's a little bar at the top that shows how far down you've scrolled.

## How to Run It

If you want to run this locally on your machine, just do this:

1.  Clone the repo usually:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SooryaS2/portfolio-website.git
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies (node_modules):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deployment

I deployed this using Vercel because it connects straight to GitHub and updates whenever I push code.

## Future Improvements

Things I want to add later:
*   Dark/Light mode toggle (currently it's just dark mode which I like better).
*   Maybe a blog section if I start writing articles.
*   Add more animations to the About section.
